        The four things to be aware of that will void a mattress warranty are:
        improper support from the frame, improper support from the foundation,
        stains and soils, or removing the law label. Remember, body impressions
        up to 1-1/2‚Äù are a considered a normal occurrence with any new mattress
        and is not an indication of structural failure. The comfort layer of the
        mattress is simply contouring to your natural curves, to give you the
        proper support and comfort that your body needs.
